Food : Gongura Chicken Biryani was delicious, the Andhra style spicy. The Chicken though was hard.

Hyderabadi Dum Biryani was not top notch but better than many other restaurants I have tried in Bangalore. It was tasty. Again Chicken condition is a drawback.

Apollo fish is supposed to be a prominent dish going by its fame. They just did some chilli chicken style minus the chicken and plus some fish.

I wish the chicken was say chewable.

Price: competitive. Reasonable in the case of Biryani and its the quantity. Fish seemed pricey for the quantity received.

Package : quite neat and hot.
